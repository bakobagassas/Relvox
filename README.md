# Relvox

Relvox is a youth-led organization dedicated to empowering girls and young women in Niger. Founded on March 8, 2024 (International Women's Day), Relvox creates safe spaces, leadership opportunities, and amplifies the voices of young people across all 8 regions of Niger.

Our Mission: 

To empower girls and contribute to the emergence of an autonomous and inclusive generation capable of exercising equitable leadership and positively transforming their societies.

Our Vision: A world where every girl has the tools to reach her full potential, where girls hold as many leadership positions as boys, and where boys themselves support equity and build a more equitable, inclusive, and prosperous society together.
